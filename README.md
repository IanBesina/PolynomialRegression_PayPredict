based on existing information on customers in general.
Using the principles of POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION
This requires a CSV output of a spreadsheet file on existing customers, 
with columns for the Customer Name (or codename), Pricing Scheme applied, Payment Terms, Product Purchased, 
Item Quantity, and Paid on Time 
(The "Paid on Time" column can be determined by comparing the date of payment vs. the due date of Payment Terms )
needed to be installed is Python 3, as well as to run the following commands to install Python libraries

# pip install pandas
# pip install numpy
# pip install matplotlib
# pip install scikit-learn

Also, please feel free to modify the determining factors, to serve your own purpose.
